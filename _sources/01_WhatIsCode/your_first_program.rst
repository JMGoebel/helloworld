Your first program
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We haven't learned anything about how to code, yet we can still write and run our first program. This is an exercise to show you how easy it is to write and run small amounts of code and a reinforcement of our principle to learn by doing.

Hello, World!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The canonical first program for nearly every programmer is referred to as "Hello, World!" The reason "Hello, World!" is so ubiquitous is because printing a single message is one of the simplest tasks a program can carry out.

"Hello, World!" will be your first program, as well. And yes, this short program is the namesake of this course! Let's get started.

In the editor below, type the following. *Do not copy/paste the code.* You'll learn best by typing, trying, and tweaking. When you've finished typing, hit the blue "Run" button to execute the code and observe the output.

.. code-block:: python

    print("Hello, World!")

.. activecode:: ch0_helloworld
  :nocodelens:

If you got everything correct, you saw the output ``Hello, World!`` If you omitted or mistyped any characters, then you either saw a misspelled message, or you saw an error message with some tips on what might have gone wrong. Read the message and try to find the problem.

We're not going to discuss the details of this line of code quite yet, but you are still encouraged to play around with it to try to learn just what is happening. Here are some questions you might ask and test:

- How can I change the message that is printed?
- What do the parentheses do? Will the code work without them? What happens if I don't include both parentheses?
- What happens if I try to print a message without quotes? What if I don't include both opening and closing quote marks?
- Can we print something other than a message?
- Can we print multiple messages at once?
- Can I print a message that itself contains quote marks, such as ``Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"``?

Spend a few minutes trying to answer these questions. Afterward, you should be able to give a fairly accurate description of how the `print` function in Python works. In fact, give this a shot! Write a brief explanation (one or two sentences) of the `print` function on paper or in a document on your computer. This should be something more detailed than: "It prints things."
